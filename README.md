# Java Demo Project - Exception Handling

This is a demo project written in Java that showcases the handling of various common exceptions. The project provides examples and explanations for the following exceptions:

1. `ClassNotFoundException`: This exception occurs when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) tries to load a class at runtime but cannot find it in the classpath. It typically happens when a class name specified in code does not exist or is misspelled.

2. `ClassCastException`: This exception is thrown when there is an attempt to cast an object to a subclass of which it is not an instance. It occurs primarily during runtime and indicates an incorrect casting operation.

3. `IncompatibleClassChangeError`: This error is thrown when a class that was previously compiled with a different version of a referenced class is loaded into the JVM. It usually happens when a method or field signature of the referenced class has changed since the referencing class was compiled.

4. `NoClassDefFoundError`: This error is thrown when the JVM tries to load a class that was previously available during compilation but is not found during runtime. It typically occurs when the referenced class is missing from the classpath or has been removed.

5. `NoSuchMethodError`: This error occurs when the JVM tries to invoke a method that is not found in the class. It typically happens when a method called in the code does not exist in the specified class or has a different signature.

6. `SecurityException`: This exception is thrown when a security violation occurs while executing code. It usually occurs when a code segment tries to perform an operation that is not allowed by the security manager.

7. `UnsupportedClassVersionError`: This error occurs when the JVM encounters a class file that was compiled with a higher version of Java than the one currently running. It indicates that the class file is not compatible with the current version of Java.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   └── java
│   │       └── com
│   │           └── databricks
│   │               └── client
│   │                   ├── ClassNotFoundExceptionDemo.java
│   │                   ├── ClassCastExceptionDemo.java
│   │                   ├── IncompatibleClassChangeErrorDemo.java
│   │                   ├── NoClassDefFoundErrorDemo.java
│   │                   ├── NoSuchMethodErrorDemo.java
│   │                   ├── SecurityExceptionDemo.java
│   │                   └── UnsupportedClassVersionErrorDemo.java
└── pom.xml
└── README.md
```

The `src` directory contains the main source code.

## Running the Project

To run the project, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Build the project by executing the following command:
   ```
   javac -d out src/main/java/com/example/Main.java
   ```
4. Run the desired exception demo by executing the following command:
   ```
   java -cp out com.example.Main [ExceptionType]
    ```
   
   Replace `[ExceptionType]` with the desired exception to be demonstrated (e.g., `ClassNotFoundExceptionDemo`).
   Example:
   ```
   java -cp out com.example.Main ClassNotFoundExceptionDemo
   ```
   
   This will execute the `ClassNotFoundExceptionDemo` and showcase the handling of the `ClassNotFoundException` exception.

## Unit Tests

The project includes unit tests for each exception demonstration. These tests can be found in the `test` directory. You can run the tests using your preferred Java testing framework (e.g., JUnit).
